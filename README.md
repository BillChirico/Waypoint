# 12-Step Tracker

A React Native mobile application for tracking AA recovery progress and facilitating sponsor-sponsee relationships through the 12-step program.

## Overview

12-Step Tracker helps individuals in recovery stay connected with their sponsors, track progress through the 12 steps, complete assigned tasks, and maintain accountability in their recovery journey.

## Features

- **Sponsor-Sponsee Relationships**: Connect sponsors with sponsees through invite codes
- **Task Management**: Sponsors can assign step-based tasks to sponsees
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion of steps and tasks
- **Direct Messaging**: Private communication between sponsors and sponsees
- **Step Content**: Access to 12-step program content and reflection prompts
- **Sobriety Tracking**: Track sobriety dates and recovery milestones
- **Relapse Support**: Private relapse tracking and recovery restart functionality
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on iOS, Android, and web
- **Secure Authentication**: Email/password and Google OAuth sign-in
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark mode with system preference detection

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Expo 54 with React Native 0.81.5 and React 19
- **Router**: Expo Router v6 (file-based routing with typed routes)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (email/password + Google OAuth)
- **Storage**: expo-secure-store (native) / localStorage (web)
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Icons**: lucide-react-native

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v22 or later recommended)
- **pnpm** (latest version)
- **Expo CLI**: Installed via `npx` or globally
- **For iOS Development** (macOS only):
  - Xcode (latest version)
  - iOS Simulator
  - CocoaPods
- **For Android Development**:
  - Android Studio
  - Android SDK (API 33 or later)
  - Android Emulator or physical device

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd 12-Step-Tracker
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Supabase credentials:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```

### 4. Set Up Supabase

The database schema is located in `supabase/migrations/`. You'll need to:

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run the migrations in your Supabase project
3. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies as defined in the migrations

## Development Commands

### Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Starts the Expo development server with telemetry disabled. Scan the QR code with Expo Go app or use a simulator.

### Run on iOS

```bash
pnpm ios
```

Builds and runs the app on iOS Simulator. **Requires macOS and Xcode.**

This compiles the native iOS code and installs the app on the simulator.

### Run on Android

```bash
pnpm android
```

Builds and runs the app on Android Emulator. **Requires Android Studio and Android SDK.**

This compiles the native Android code and installs the app on the emulator or connected device.

### Build for Web

```bash
pnpm build:web
```

Exports the app for web deployment to the `dist` folder.

### Type Checking

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

Runs TypeScript compiler in check mode without emitting files.

### Linting

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Runs ESLint using Expo's lint configuration.

### Code Formatting

```bash
pnpm format
```

Formats all code using Prettier.

```bash
pnpm format:check
```

Checks if code is properly formatted without making changes.

### Git Hooks

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for Git hooks with [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) to ensure code quality before commits.

**Pre-commit Hook**: Automatically runs on every commit to:

- **Format code**: Prettier auto-formats **all** staged files (uses `--ignore-unknown` for unsupported types)
- **Lint and fix**: ESLint auto-fixes staged JavaScript/TypeScript files
- **Auto-stage**: Fixed files are automatically added back to staging

**Configuration**:

- Hook script: `.husky/pre-commit`
- Lint-staged config: `package.json` → `lint-staged` section
- Detailed documentation: `.github/GIT_HOOKS.md`

The hooks run only on **staged files**, keeping commits fast (typically <1 second) and ensuring all committed code meets quality standards.

**Setup**: Hooks are automatically installed when you run `pnpm install` (via the `prepare` script).

**Skip hooks** (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify
# or
git commit -n
```

**Note**: Pre-commit hooks do NOT run TypeScript type checking (too slow). Run `pnpm typecheck` manually before pushing, or let CI catch type errors.

## Testing

### Unit and Component Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests in CI mode
pnpm test:ci
```

### E2E Tests with Maestro

See [.maestro/README.md](.maestro/README.md) for E2E testing documentation.

```bash
# Run all E2E flows
maestro test .maestro/flows

# Run specific flow
maestro test .maestro/flows/00-smoke-test.yaml
```

### Coverage

Currently tracking 2 tests as baseline. See [docs/plans/2025-01-11-testing-infrastructure-design.md](docs/plans/2025-01-11-testing-infrastructure-design.md) for expansion plan.

```

## Authentication Flow

The app enforces a strict navigation flow:

1. **Unauthenticated users** → `/login`
2. **Authenticated but no profile** → `/onboarding`
3. **Authenticated with incomplete profile** → `/onboarding`
4. **Fully set up users** → `/(tabs)` (main app)

## Google OAuth Setup

Google Sign-In is integrated but requires additional configuration. See `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions including:

- Google Cloud Console configuration
- Supabase provider setup
- OAuth redirect URIs
- Mobile deep linking configuration

**App Details:**

- Bundle ID (iOS): `com.billchirico.12steptracker`
- Package name (Android): `com.billchirico.twelvesteptracker`
- Deep link scheme: `12stepstracker://`

## EAS Build

This project is configured for Expo Application Services (EAS) builds:

```bash
# Development build
eas build --profile development --platform [ios|android]

# Preview build (used by CI/CD)
eas build --profile preview --platform [ios|android]

# Production build
eas build --profile production --platform [ios|android]

# Build for both platforms
eas build --profile preview --platform all
```

**EAS Project ID**: `4652ad8b-2e44-4270-8612-64c4587219d8`

### Build Profiles

The project includes three build profiles configured in `eas.json`:

- **development**: Development client with internal distribution for testing
- **preview**: Internal distribution for CI/CD and QA testing (uses Release configuration)
- **production**: Production builds with auto-increment version numbers

The **preview** profile is used by the CI/CD pipeline and includes:

- Internal distribution for easy testing
- OTA update channel (`preview`)
- Environment variables for Supabase integration
- Release build configuration for iOS
- APK output for Android (faster than AAB for testing)

## Database Schema

The database includes the following main tables:

- **profiles**: User information, roles, sobriety dates, preferences
- **sponsor_sponsee_relationships**: Sponsor-sponsee connections
- **tasks**: Step-based assignments
- **messages**: Direct messaging
- **steps_content**: 12-step program content
- **notifications**: In-app notifications
- **invite_codes**: Sponsor invitation system
- **relapses**: Private relapse tracking

All tables are secured with Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensuring proper data access control.

## Contributing

This is a private project for recovery support. If you're contributing, please ensure:

- All code passes TypeScript type checking (`pnpm typecheck`)
- Code follows the linting rules (`pnpm lint`)
- Code is properly formatted (`pnpm format:check` or run `pnpm format`)

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and builds.

### CI Pipeline

The CI workflow runs on every push to `main` and `develop` as well as on all pull requests:

1. **Lint, Format, and Type Check** - Validates code quality, formatting, and TypeScript types
2. **Build for Web** - Creates production web build
3. **Build for Android** - Triggers EAS build for Android (preview profile)
4. **Build for iOS** - Triggers EAS build for iOS (preview profile)

### Claude Code Review

Pull requests automatically trigger an AI-powered code review workflow that:

- 🔄 **Updates in real-time** - Uses a sticky comment that tracks review progress
- ⚡ **Cancels outdated reviews** - New commits automatically cancel previous reviews
- 🔍 **Comprehensive analysis** - Checks TypeScript types, ESLint rules, and Prettier formatting
- 🤖 **AI insights** - Detects common issues like `any` types, console.logs, and TODO comments
- 📊 **Quality report** - Provides detailed pass/fail status for all checks

The review comment updates throughout the process, showing progress from "in progress" to final results with actionable recommendations.
