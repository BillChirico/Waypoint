## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v22 or later recommended)
- **pnpm** (latest version)
- **Expo CLI**: Installed via `npx` or globally
- **For iOS Development** (macOS only):
  - Xcode (latest version)
  - iOS Simulator
  - CocoaPods
- **For Android Development**:
  - Android Studio
  - Android SDK (API 33 or later)
  - Android Emulator or physical device

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd 12-Step-Tracker
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Supabase credentials:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```

### 4. Set Up Supabase

The database schema is located in `supabase/migrations/`. You'll need to:

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run the migrations in your Supabase project
3. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies as defined in the migrations

## Development Commands

### Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Starts the Expo development server with telemetry disabled. Scan the QR code with Expo Go app or use a simulator.

### Run on iOS

```bash
pnpm ios
```

Builds and runs the app on iOS Simulator. **Requires macOS and Xcode.**

This compiles the native iOS code and installs the app on the simulator.

### Run on Android

```bash
pnpm android
```

Builds and runs the app on Android Emulator. **Requires Android Studio and Android SDK.**

This compiles the native Android code and installs the app on the emulator or connected device.

### Build for Web

```bash
pnpm build:web
```

Exports the app for web deployment to the `dist` folder.

### Type Checking

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

Runs TypeScript compiler in check mode without emitting files.

### Linting

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Runs ESLint using Expo's lint configuration.

### Code Formatting

```bash
pnpm format
```

Formats all code using Prettier.

```bash
pnpm format:check
```

Checks if code is properly formatted without making changes.

### Git Hooks

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for Git hooks with [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) to ensure code quality before commits.

**Pre-commit Hook**: Automatically runs on every commit to:

- Format staged files with Prettier
- Lint and auto-fix staged TypeScript/JavaScript files with ESLint

The hooks run only on staged files, keeping commits fast and ensuring all committed code meets quality standards.

**Setup**: Hooks are automatically installed when you run `pnpm install` (via the `prepare` script).

**Skip hooks** (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

```

## Authentication Flow

The app enforces a strict navigation flow:

1. **Unauthenticated users** → `/login`
2. **Authenticated but no profile** → `/onboarding`
3. **Authenticated with incomplete profile** → `/onboarding`
4. **Fully set up users** → `/(tabs)` (main app)

## Google OAuth Setup

Google Sign-In is integrated but requires additional configuration. See `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions including:

- Google Cloud Console configuration
- Supabase provider setup
- OAuth redirect URIs
- Mobile deep linking configuration

**App Details:**

- Bundle ID (iOS): `com.billchirico.12steptracker`
- Package name (Android): `com.billchirico.twelvesteptracker`
- Deep link scheme: `12stepstracker://`

## EAS Build

This project is configured for Expo Application Services (EAS) builds:

```bash
# Development build
eas build --profile development --platform [ios|android]

# Preview build (used by CI/CD)
eas build --profile preview --platform [ios|android]

# Production build
eas build --profile production --platform [ios|android]

# Build for both platforms
eas build --profile preview --platform all
```

**EAS Project ID**: `4652ad8b-2e44-4270-8612-64c4587219d8`

The project includes three build profiles configured in `eas.json`:

- **development**: Development client with internal distribution for testing
- **preview**: Internal distribution for CI/CD and QA testing (uses Release configuration)
- **production**: Production builds with auto-increment version numbers

The **preview** profile is used by the CI/CD pipeline and includes:

- Internal distribution for easy testing
- OTA update channel (`preview`)
- Environment variables for Supabase integration
- Release build configuration for iOS
- APK output for Android (faster than AAB for testing)

## Database Schema

The database includes the following main tables:

- **profiles**: User information, roles, sobriety dates, preferences
- **sponsor_sponsee_relationships**: Sponsor-sponsee connections
- **tasks**: Step-based assignments
- **messages**: Direct messaging
- **steps_content**: 12-step program content
- **notifications**: In-app notifications
- **invite_codes**: Sponsor invitation system
- **relapses**: Private relapse tracking

All tables are secured with Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensuring proper data access control.
